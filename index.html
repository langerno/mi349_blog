                    I absolutely love cooking but I can never find time to during school, especially with work and homework. I did find an extremely tasty hamburger-helper-esque 
                    premade meal that I can mix in some veggies and mushrooms to get a little more flavor and nutrition. It's the Velveeta meals, they are so good. In particular I 
                    like to get the Beef Stroganoff flavor, i never really liked beef stroganoff before but this thing to so delicious I could eat the entire package in one night
                    without hesitation if the amount of cheese sauce didn't make me fear for my health. Everytime I make it I struggle to not eat the whole thing, 
                    they are extremely good.

                    After my last post I realized that I am, in fact, very hungry and that is being represented through my blog posts. I have left 
                    over Velveeta Creamy Beef Stroganoff so as soon as I am done with my homework and back home I am going to eat all of my leftovers.
                    I also have to clean my dishes from when I made it last night, the pan is just sitting out and I'm sure my roommates
                    aren't extremely happy about that but I was very tired after work and working on a project for CSE 335 and 
                    completely forgot to clean it before I went to bed. I noticed this morning before work but realized I was already
                    almost late to work and cleaning it would mean being more late to work so I left it. They will be alright I think,
                    I do their dishes more than I'd like anyway.
